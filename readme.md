兴趣使然

This project is build to prove if I can realy get the hang of things that I thought I've acquired.

To be specific, this project will be a project focus on front-end develop.

I wanna use React&Webpack for views, Flask for back-end, and maybe Docker for deployment.

Emmmmm, I dont have anything else to say.

Let's have fun:

To run this project, you need install npm first.

Then clone this project, run 'npm install'

After dependencies installed, run 'npm start'

You'll see a website on http://0.0.0.0:9727/
