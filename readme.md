兴趣使然

This project is build to prove if I can realy get the hang of things that I thought I've acquired.

To be specific, this project will be a project focus on front-end develop.

I wanna use React&Webpack for views, Flask for back-end, and maybe Docker for deployment.

Emmmmm, I dont have anything else to say.

Let's have fun.
